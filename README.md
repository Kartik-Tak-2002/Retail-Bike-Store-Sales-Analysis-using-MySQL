## Retail Bike Store Sales Analysis (MySQL)

This project focuses on analyzing retail bike store sales data using **MySQL**.
It involves exploring and understanding relationships between multiple tables, including **orders, order_items, products, and customers**.

The data was cleaned through **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** by addressing missing values, removing invalid entries, and resolving data inconsistencies.

Key business questions were answered around **revenue trends, top-selling products, store and regional performance, customer spending behavior, and inventory risk**.

The final outcomes translate SQL query results into **actionable insights** to support better **sales strategies and inventory planning**.
